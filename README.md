This is the source code for chucklesthedirtchipmuffin.com

There may be a few interesting things in here, though mostly it is a just a website implemented using node.js, express, and handlebars.

The chuckleschat.hbs view implements a persistent URL for all the chuckles chat messages
using a Vue.js router.  

It uses Google Cloud storage for both the chuckles chat messages and the chapters of the books.
